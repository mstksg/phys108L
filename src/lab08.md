Preface
=======

Welcome back to Physics 108 Lab!  The lab where we try to experience the
*magic* and *messiness* of physics and electromagnetism in our homes.  After
learning about capacitors as physical devices, we looked at the idea of
resistance and what it means for something to be "Ohmic".

This property means that current flow is directly proportional to applied
pressure (voltage, or water pressure, or whatever), and is a universal idea
that can be applied to things other than electrical components.  If it's
*proportional*, it's ohmic, and so has a *resistance* $R$, the reciprocal of
the slope.

In the last lab's procedure, we tested the idea that *straws* are ohmic
devices: the current flow through them is directly proportional to the pressure
you apply on one end.  We even directly calculated the resistance $R$ of three
different types of straw: small, large, and clogged.

Hopefully from that you were able to "feel" the idea of resistance and what it
really "means".  It's not just something you can check with a multimeter and
read off...it's a *proportionality constant* that reflects a real physical
process you can experience.

In this week's lab, we are going to continue our straw resistance experiments
by trying to see what happens to resistors if we *combine* them together.

Objectives & Materials
======================

We looked at resistors on their own.  But what happens if we combine resistors
by chaining them in different ways?

1.  Are the resulting combinations *also* ohmic?
2.  If so, can we infer the final resistance from the resistances of the
    individual components?
3.  How does the resistance of the individual parts affect the flow through
    them in the combined component?

The materials will be the same as for the previous lab, except now you will be
using two *identical* straws.

1.  A sink with a working faucet of running water
2.  A medium-sized plastic zip-lock sandwich bag
3.  A sharpie or marker
4.  Paper towel or tearable plastic wrap
3.  *Two of the **same** type/size of straws*
4.  A measuring cup, with a capacity of at least two cups
6.  Optional: A "stop watch" device (like an app on a smartphone or a website).
    Most smartphones come pre-installed with one; there are also many free ones
    online as well as webpages.

Procedure
=========

### Setup

The setup will be the same as last week's lab (Lab 7).

That is, take your zip-lock bag and make marks along the edge for "one
quarter full", "one third full", "halfway full", and "two thirds full".

Water pressure depends on how full the bag is.  So if the bag is half full
of water, the water pressure will "1/2 bags".  If the bag is a quarter full
of water, the water pressure will be "1/4 bags".

The procedure for each measurement is again the same:

> **Resistance Measurement Experimental Procedure**
>
> 1.  Fill the zip lock bag up to the point you want to use.  Then, begin to
>     close it up halfway.  This will be how you set up the initial "voltage".
>
> 2.  Insert the straw you are measuring into the bag from the top, so that it
>     sticks out of the bag.  Completely seal the bag so that water is only
>     allowed to escape out of the straw.
>
>     ![A set up bag and straw for 1/2 Bag Voltage](media/lab/lab07-water-small.jpg){width=30em}
>
> 3.  Over the measuring cup (in the sink), tip the bag over so that the straw is
>     *horizontal*, and so that water will begin to flow out.  It should flow
>     into the measuring cup.[^measure]  Let it flow for a total of three seconds (time it
>     yourself in your head, or use a stopwatch and wait for three seconds[^time] to
>     pass).  You may have to use your finger to keep the seal tight so no water
>     flows from the bag except for through the straw.  Make sure that the
>     straw's inner opening isn't being restricted so that water can
>     flow freely through the straw.
>
>     ![Position for pouring the water.  Remember to keep the straw and the bag
>     level and horizontal, and make sure you aren't restricting the flow on
>     the inside of the bag](media/lab/lab07-pour-small.jpg){width=30em}
>
> 4.  Measure the water that was collected by your cup.  The average
>     current: it is the volume divided by the time you waited.  For example,
>     if 400 mL of was collected over three seconds, then the average current is
>     $400/3 = 133 \mathrm{mL}/\mathrm{s}$.

[^measure]: If your measuring cup is too small or is difficult to pour into,
you can instead pour it into a normal cup and measure it afterwards by pouring
the cup's contents into the measuring cup.

[^time]: You can use a different amount of time if it works better for your
zip-lock bag, just remember to use that duration when dividing the volume in
the next step.

### Filling out the table
