Preface
=======

Magnets --- how do they work?  Scientists have some ideas, if we ask them.  For
most of my life I felt like they were something fantastical and magical.
When I started studying physics, I was afraid that it would rob this feeling
from me.  However, to my surprise, it didn't.  Instead, it made it feel
fantastical, magical ... and controllable.  (Of course, it wasn't exactly a
straightforward path from beginning to end.)

So, let's start taking these first steps.  What are magnets, and what is
magnetism?

Objectives & Materials
======================

The objectives of this lab are:

1.  Understand the behavior of the magnetic field generated by permanent
    magnets.
2.  Understand how the physical configuration of wires affects the magnetic
    fields they generate.

The materials involved are:

1.  A smart-phone capable of downloading Google Play or Apple App Store
    applications.
2.  A small
2.  A measuring device.
3.  *Optional*:

    a.  One AA battery
    b.  At least two paperclips
    c.
